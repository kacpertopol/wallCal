This is the default calendar file.

Calendar events start with a '#' followed by an event time specification.
Specification examples:

	Y2021                           - event in given year
	M03                             - event in given month
	D05                             - event in given day
	h04                             - event in given hour
	m08                             - event in given minute
	W05                             - event taking place during the fifth week of the year
	w3                              - event taking place on a Wednesday
	>2021-03-05                     - event after date
	<2021-03-05                     - event before date
	>=2021-03-05                    - event after or on date
	<=2021-03-05                    - event before or on date
	>21:22                          - event after time
	<21:22                          - event before time
	>=21:22                         - event after time or on this time
	<=21:22                         - event before time or on this time

Specifications can be joined using ( &) and ( |) that
apply the and or operator to specifications inside.
Carefull, spaces must be present around the brackets and
before $,|. Some examples:

	( ( w3 H14 &) ( w7 H17 &) |)    - event at 14 hours on Wednesday
									  or 17 hours on Sunday
	( ( w1 w2 w3 |) H14 &)          - event taking place on 
									  on Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday
									  at 14 hours.

The first line after the time specification is the title of the event.
The event type can be placed in the title following a colon ':'.

	ALARM                           - events with this type will appear in the 
                                      "important events" section
	TODO                            - events with this type will not appear
                                      in the timetable but will appear
                                      in the daily "things to do" section

This can be followed by a number of lines of text - this will be 
interpreted as the event description. The double '##' terminates the event.

Carefull, spaces must be inserted between all elements of the specification.
